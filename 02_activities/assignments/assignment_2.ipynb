    "It's good, it avoids the necessity to swap elements in place which can be more complex and error-prone. The approach is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a good solution for the problem at hand. I would have used a numpy array since we're dealing with integers and numpy is optimized for numerical operations, and sorting by vectorization is going to be faster on large lists. However, it's possible the need to keep the order of numbers that are not sequentially descending to zero would be too complicated for a numpy approach, I would have to spend some time with the documentation to see if it's feasible."

    "In assignment 1, I defined the is_valid_brackets function first with a map to define which pairs of brackets are valid. I used the values of the map to load a set of open brackets and the keys to load a set of closing brackets. I did a simple test to find out if, logically, the brackets can't be paired, if there are an odd number of brackets, the string starts with a closing bracket, or it ends with an opening bracket. I did this just to take care of a few really simple edge cases where I could make the order of the function O(1) instead of O(n). Then I defined a stack and iterated through the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack, and popping them off when I found a closing bracket that matched the last opening bracket. If I found a closing bracket that didn't match, I returned false. At the end of the function, if the stack was empty, I returned true, otherwise false.\n",

    "For the second assignment, I implemented a BST from scratch. I moved the definition to the first code cell of this document so that some of the functionality required could be implemented as class methods rather than procedural code. I implemented a repr method that includes both the paths to leaves of the tree and a display of the tree itself. To test the insertion, duplicate detection, and path finding methods, I created a random tree generator function that creates a binary tree of random integers. I created three different trees to test the functionality, one balanced, one unbalanced, and one with duplicates. I printed the trees and the results of the duplicate detection and path finding methods to verify that they were working correctly. I thought about writing rotations to balance the tree, but I think that would be a bit beyond the scope of this assignment."
